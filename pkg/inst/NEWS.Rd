\section{Changes in Version 0.5-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed a bug when using the \code{subset} argument.
    \item Added tolerance for normalization check to \code{DR_data}.
    \item moved \code{NEWS} to the new fancy \code{NEWS.Rd} file/format.
    \item Added the possibility to do quick analyses and transforming data \dQuote{on the fly}, like \code{DirichReg(DR_data(A) ~ 1)}.
          However this is only intended for quick checking purposes and may be removed at any time.
  }
}
\section{Changes in Version 0.5-0}{
  \itemize{
    \item Transformation in \code{DR_data} is now not only \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}, but, by default, a small numeric value to avoid troubles with floating point numbers close to 0 or 1.
    \item Time-critical routines were implemented in \code{C} (pure \R versions are available, see \code{?ddirichlet}).
    \item \code{anova.DirichletRegModel} now invisibly returns results as an object that is printed by a method.
    \item Optimized estimation routines.
    \item Fixed a bug in the predict method.
    \item Started development of a comprehensive test-suite using \pkg{testthat}.
    \item Published a working paper on the package:\cr%
          Maier, M. J. (2014). DirichletReg: Dirichlet Regression for Compositional Data in R. Research Report Series / Department of Statistics and Mathematics, 125. WU Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna. \url{http://epub.wu.ac.at/4077/}
    \item Added vignette with code to the working paper.
    \item Added citation info.
  }
}
\section{Changes in Version 0.4-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item The \code{trafo} Argument of \code{DR_data} has been changed, because it has lead to problems in practical applications when numbers very close to 0 or 1 were present.
    \item \code{DR_data} checks for negative values and generates an appropriate error message.
    \item \code{DR_data} has been made more robust in the presence of \code{NA}s.
  }
}
\section{Changes in Version 0.4-0}{
  \itemize{
    \item Data structure generated by \code{DR_data} has changed – the new objects can now be integrated into data frames.
    \item Formula processing is now handled by the package \pkg{Formula}.
    \item New methods have been implemented, especially for the class \code{DirichletRegModel}.
    \item The documentation is now quite complete.
    \item Some speed improvements could be achieved.
    \item Lots of minor (invisible) changes.
  }
}
\section{Changes in Version 0.002}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added the analytical Gradient and Hessian for both parametrizations.
    \item Optimization: preliminary results by \acronym{BFGS} that become starting values for Newton-Raphson optimization computing the final results.
    \item Implemented some residuals
    \item Updated help entries
