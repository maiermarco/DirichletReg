Changes in Version 0.5-0

  * Transformation in DR_data is now not only TRUE/FALSE, but, by default, a small numeric value to avoid troubles with floating point numbers close to 0 or 1.
  
  * Time-critical routines were implemented in C (pure R versions are available, see ?ddirichlet).
  
  * anova.DirichletRegModel now invisibly returns results as an object that is printed by a method.
  
  * Optimized estimation routines.
  
  * Fixed a bug in the predict method.
  
  * Started development of a comprehensive test-suite using "testthat".
  
  * Published a working paper on the package: Maier, M. J. (2014). DirichletReg: Dirichlet Regression for Compositional Data in R. Research Report Series / Department of Statistics and Mathematics, 125. WU Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna. http://epub.wu.ac.at/4077/
  
  * Added vignette with code to the working paper.
  
  * Added citation info.

Changes in Version 0.4-1

  * The "trafo" Argument of DR_data() has been changed, because it has lead to problems in practical applications when numbers very close to 0 or 1 were present.

  * DR_data() checks for negative values and generates an appropriate error message.
  
  * DR_data() has been made more robust in the presence of NAs.

Changes in Version 0.4-0

  * Data structure generated by DR_data() has changed -- the new objects can now be integrated into data frames.
  
  * Formula processing is now handled by the package `Formula'.
  
  * New methods have been implemented, especially for the class DirichletRegModel.

  * The documentation is now quite complete.

  * Some speed improvements could be achieved.
  
  * Lots of minor (invisible) changes.

Changes in Version 0.002

  * Added the analytical Gradient and Hessian for both parametrizations.
  
  * Optimization: preliminary results by BFGS that become starting values for Newton-Raphson optimization computing the final results.

  * Implemented some residuals
  
  * Updated help entries
