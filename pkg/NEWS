News for Package 'DirichletReg'

Changes in Version 0.6-2:

  • Fixed an error in the ternary plot (bottom axis tick labels were
    printed in reversed order; pointed out by Emilio A. Laca).

  • Imports functions from default packages, as required by the new
    CRAN-check.
  • Changed the 'Description' field to eliminate the note "Malformed
    Description field: should contain one or more complete sentences."
    when checking the package.

Changes in Version 0.6-1:

  • Re-derived gradients/Hessians, optimized C-code, and tweaked
    computation of starting values which leads to considerably better
    performance.

  • Fixed some bugs in 'drop1'.

  • Expanded 'testthat' checks.

Changes in Version 0.6-0:

  • All likelihood and gradient functions are now written in C (all
    called via '.Call()' now instead of '.C()') which leads to a
    considerable gain in speed.

  • A 'drop1' method for Dirichlet regression models was added.  As it
    is still experimental and will probably change, use it with care.
    Options such as 'scope' will be added in one of the next releases.

  • Fixed a bug in the 'print' method for confidence intervals and one
    in 'confint.DirichletRegModel()'.

  • Expanded the 'testthat' check- and test-suite.

  • Known issue: If you have collinear (aliased) terms, the estimation
    will fail.  This will be handled automatically in subsequent
    releases, but for now, please remove the respective terms.  If you
    fit a model and it says something like:
    
    Error in prepareFixed(start = start, activePar = NULL, fixed = fixed) :
    At least one parameter must not be fixed using argument 'fixed'
    you most likely have collinear terms or "empty" combinations of
    interaction terms.

Changes in Version 0.5-2:

  • Fixed checking functions in 'tests/testthat'.

Changes in Version 0.5-1:

  • Fixed a bug when using the 'subset' argument.

  • Added tolerance for normalization check to 'DR_data'.

  • moved 'NEWS' to the new fancy 'NEWS.Rd' file/format.

  • Added the possibility to do quick analyses and transforming data
    "on the fly", like 'DirichReg(DR_data(A) ~ 1)'.  However this is
    only intended for quick checking purposes and may be removed at any
    time.

Changes in Version 0.5-0:

  • Transformation in 'DR_data' is now not only 'TRUE'/'FALSE', but, by
    default, a small numeric value to avoid troubles with floating
    point numbers close to 0 or 1.

  • Time-critical routines were implemented in 'C' (pure R versions are
    available, see '?ddirichlet').

  • 'anova.DirichletRegModel' now invisibly returns results as an
    object that is printed by a method.

  • Optimized estimation routines.

  • Fixed a bug in the predict method.

  • Started development of a comprehensive test-suite using 'testthat'.

  • Published a working paper on the package:
    Maier, M. J. (2014). DirichletReg: Dirichlet Regression for
    Compositional Data in R. Research Report Series / Department of
    Statistics and Mathematics, 125. WU Vienna University of Economics
    and Business, Vienna. <URL: http://epub.wu.ac.at/4077/>

  • Added vignette with code to the working paper.

  • Added citation info.

Changes in Version 0.4-1:

  • The 'trafo' Argument of 'DR_data' has been changed, because it has
    lead to problems in practical applications when numbers very close
    to 0 or 1 were present.

  • 'DR_data' checks for negative values and generates an appropriate
    error message.

  • 'DR_data' has been made more robust in the presence of 'NA's.

Changes in Version 0.4-0:

  • Data structure generated by 'DR_data' has changed – the new objects
    can now be integrated into data frames.

  • Formula processing is now handled by the package 'Formula'.

  • New methods have been implemented, especially for the class
    'DirichletRegModel'.

  • The documentation is now quite complete.

  • Some speed improvements could be achieved.

  • Lots of minor (invisible) changes.

Changes in Version 0.002:

  • Added the analytical Gradient and Hessian for both
    parametrizations.

  • Optimization: preliminary results by BFGS that become starting
    values for Newton-Raphson optimization computing the final results.

  • Implemented some residuals

  • Updated help entries
